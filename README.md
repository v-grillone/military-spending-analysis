# About

In this notebook, I analyze the data of military spending to create a picture of what country is spending the most and how their spending habits compare currently to its past.

I first take a look at the total picture with data from the past 50 years and see all together what a countries military spending has looked like.

Then I divide the data into 5 ten year chunks, to see a country's recent military spending is in comparison to its past.

With the divided data I create a line chart of the top 10 military spenders for an easy to see the visualization of how these strong military countries are trending.

Then I finish the notebook off with a violin plot of the total data, which provided a further understanding of how much the vast majority of countries are spending on the military and who the outliers are.
